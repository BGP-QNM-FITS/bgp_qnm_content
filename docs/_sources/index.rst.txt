This website contains figures which supplement the paper 
`The quasinormal mode content of binary black hole ringdown (Dyer & Moore, submitted) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13954>`_.

Links (on the left) provide access to figures for each of the 13 publicly available Cauchy characteristic evolved (CCE) 
NR simulations provided by SXS (see `Moxon+ 2020 for more details on CCE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01339>`_). 
Simulations can be accessed `here <https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/extcce_catalog.html>`_. 

The code used to produce the analyses and figures on this website is available `here <https://github.com/BGP-QNM-FITS/bgp_qnm_content>`_ 
and the full Bayesian methodology is described in `Dyer & Moore (submitted) <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11783>`_.

We use a fully Bayesian framework to fit the ringdown, model the uncertainty on the waveforms, and give posterior distributions on the QNM amplitudes, 
remnant mass, and remnant spin. Example posteriors for the (2, 2, n, +) QNMs at 10M are shown below.
