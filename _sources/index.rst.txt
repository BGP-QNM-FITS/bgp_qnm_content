QNM Content Site
============================================

This website contains links (on the left) to the mode content and amplitude stabilities of various target 
modes at a range of start times from each of the 13 simulations in the SXS CCE catalog. 
Each page also contains fits, residuals, and a comparison of the mass and spin posteriors to 
models which do not dynamically remove QNMs at each t0.
