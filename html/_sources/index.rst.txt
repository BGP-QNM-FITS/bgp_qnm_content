QNM Content Site
============================================

This website contains links (on the left) to the mode content and amplitude stabilities of various target 
modes at a range of start times for each of the 13 publicly available Cauchy characteristic evolved (CCE) 
NR simulations provided by SXS (see `Moxon+ 2020 for more details on CCE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01339>`_). 

The simulations can be accessed `here <https://data.black-holes.org/waveforms/extcce_catalog.html>`_. 

Each page also contains fits, residuals, and a comparison of the mass and spin posteriors to 
models which do not dynamically remove QNMs at each t0. 

The code used to produce the analyses and figures on this website is available `here <https://github.com/BGP-QNM-FITS/bgp_qnm_content>`_.
